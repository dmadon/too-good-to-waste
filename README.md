# Too Good To Waste

## Description
A MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, food waste, with a focus on data and user demand.

## Goal
Partner grocery stores can update their inventory of food that must leave the store due to expiration. Users of the website can login and select food that is still good but would normally be thrown away and reserve/order items at a discounted price. The users would then go to their store location and pickup their order. This would not only save users money but also save food from being wasted.

## User Story
As a user, I want a way to purchase food so that I can reduce food waste.

## Technologies Used

* MongoDB for the database
* Queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data
* Deployed using Heroku
